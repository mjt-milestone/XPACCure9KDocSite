!!! glass "Recommended user configuration"
    It's recommended to map users logically from your domain, to XProtect, to CCure and to their partition. This lets SSO in XProtect work with the personalized log-in feature, and with partitions within CCure, to simplify the log-in experience, while also customizing and controlling the integrated Smart Client.
