# Client profiles and roles explained

Smart Client profiles and user roles in XProtect allow administrators to control the features available in the XProtect Smart Client.

Smart Client profiles allow control over the visibility of access request notifications. Roles allow control over access control globally, visibility of the cardholder list, and access request notifications. For example, if a user cannot receive access request notifications it could be disabled in both the Smart Client profile that user is assigned, or in their role.
