In the **Access Monitor Settings** window, open the lists to select the door, sources, cameras, events, commands, and the order in which new events appear in the access monitor. Once the door is selected, many of the other options will change, based upon the available cameras, events, and commands. The access monitor view item can be added to any available view pane and works in a view alongside all available view items.
